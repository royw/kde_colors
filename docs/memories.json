Updated reference_outputter.md to document ReferenceOutputter class and its methods\n5. Added exceptions.md to document all exception classes\n6. Added reference.md to document the Reference model class\n7. Fixed verify_docs.py script to correctly handle class methods and module-level functions\n8. All functions are now documented and verified by the docs:verify task",

Using a two-pass approach to first collect class methods and then collect module-level functions that aren't already class methods\n\nThis ensures that class methods like AliasOutputter.output, PropertiesOutputter.output, etc. are correctly identified as class methods and not mistakenly treated as missing module-level functions.",
